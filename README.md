**TL;DR**: If you're getting the `"Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component"` error in React Native and your code is correct, **downgrade to React Native 0.72.17** - it works!

## 🚨 The Problem

React Native apps crash immediately on Android with:
```
E ReactNativeJS: Error: Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component.
E AndroidRuntime: com.facebook.react.common.JavascriptException: Error: Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component.
```

**Even when your code is 100% correct** with all text inside `<Text>` components.

## ✅ The Solution That Works

**React Native 0.72.17 + React 18.2.0**

```bash
npx react-native@0.72.17 init YourApp --version 0.72.17
```

## ❌ Confirmed Broken Versions

After extensive testing:
- ❌ React Native 0.75.x (all sub-versions)
- ❌ React Native 0.76.x  
- ❌ React Native 0.80.0

## 🔍 Investigation Summary

### What We Tested
- ✅ Clean cache (Metro, Gradle, npm)
- ✅ Minimal code (just basic Text components)
- ✅ Multiple React Native versions
- ✅ Different devices and emulators
- ✅ Hermes vs JavaScriptCore
- ✅ **Fresh projects created with CLI**

### Key Discovery
**The error occurs even in brand new projects** created with the React Native CLI, proving it's a **systematic issue with newer versions**, not user code.

## 🎯 For Existing Projects

### Migration Steps
1. Create new project with RN 0.72.17
2. Copy your `src/` folder
3. Copy `assets/` folder  
4. Install compatible navigation dependencies:
   ```json
   {
     "@react-navigation/native": "6.1.9",
     "@react-navigation/stack": "6.3.20",
     "react-native-screens": "3.25.0",
     "react-native-safe-area-context": "4.7.4"
   }
   ```
